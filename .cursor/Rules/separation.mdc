# Separation Rules
- **Single Response**
Each file should represent one distinct unit of work.

- **Component Breakdown:**
Break features into self-contained components.

- **Use Hooks**
Encapsulate logic and data access in custom hooks

- **Global vs. Local**
  - **Global** Place reusable components and hooks in shared/global folders.
  - **Local:** Keep object-specific components and hooks in localized folders.

- **Separation of Concerns:**
Maintain clear boundaries when creating or refactoring files.

- **Readable and Declarative Code**
Rendered code should be very legible and clear. It should not include flow logic or ternary operators where possible.
